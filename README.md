# JoonPark.me

This is the repository for my personal portfolio site, [JoonPark.me](http://joonpark.me). Not only was it designed to showcase what I do, but it also served as a great chance to design a site using as much HTML and CSS as possible. The site runs on a minimal amount of JavaScript and building the site this way allowed me to really dig into the features of CSS3 that I wasn't as familiar with.
